### Tariff Prediction Model

#### 1. Project Overview:

The Tariff Prediction Model project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the value of the service fee offered by a given Brazilian financial institution. The model will analyze historical data from financial institutions made available by the Central Bank of Brazil to identify patterns of falling and rising values. By predicting fluctuations in the tariff value, the user will be able to take proactive measures to minimize his costs for using the services.

#### 2. Project Objectives:

* Develop a predictive model that accurately indicates the variation in the service fee offered by a financial institution.

* Assist the user in making a decision in choosing the best financial institution for their needs.

#### 3. Project Scope:

* **Data collection**: Obtain service fee data from financial institutions through open data from the central bank of Brazil.

* **Data Pre-Processing**: Clean and prepare data to handle missing values, outliers and ensure data quality.

* **Model Development**: Build and train a machine learning model using Random Forest Regression algorithm for time series.

* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

* **Model Deployment**: Deploy the predictive model on a Flask server to be consumed by the frontend application.

* **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor and update the model to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.
